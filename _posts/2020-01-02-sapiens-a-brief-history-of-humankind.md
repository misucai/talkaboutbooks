This book was my best read this year! The author, Yuval Noah Harari, has written a brief, yet exhaustive analysis of human history.

<!--more-->

 It answers questions like:

1. Where did we come from? (though this is a little ambiguous)
2. Why are we the way we are?
3. What would have happened had things happened a different way? (The various possibilities)
4. Where are we headed? And many more.

The book helps us gain perspective into the issues that humans had faced/are facing/will face.

According to me, everyone should read this book. It will help you debunk various misconceptions that you might have, about issues pertaining to various events in our history. For example, I was of the view that the human evolution was linear (i.e. from Homo Erectus to Neanderthals to Homo Sapiens).

The book taught me that the Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens co-existed. Later, we (Homo Sapiens) drove the Neanderthals into extinction!

In the current age, where issues such as global warming and it's related effects are evident, this book helps us introspect and realise our mistakes, though the mistakes were inevitable. More generally if not these mistakes, we would have made other mistakes, maybe equally grave! Well, the takeaway is to learn from them and not to repeat them (However humans seem to never learn).
