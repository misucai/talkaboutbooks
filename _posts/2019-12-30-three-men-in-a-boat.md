Until 8th grade I was of the opinion that anything recommended to me by school was something to be dealt with by holding a certain distance to the material and not developing any sort of interest towards it.

I don't know if this was because I hated school, the kids, the teachers or just the fact that I was sick of authority and already had it impinged on my mind that school =bad. In 8th grade I was assigned to read a book which made me experience abject cognitive dissonance.This was because anything I had read up until that point **AND** enjoyed was purely non-scholastic.

Anyway, without further ado that book was Three Men In A Boat.I know it's not some literary classic or a masterpiece or anything but there's just something about it that I can't quite articulate my thoughts about well enough to tell you why I liked it so much. The book doesn't for a moment pretend it's anything but a collection of anecdotes about three middle aged men fucking around . Maybe it's the honesty and lack of pretension but that's just a small part.

It contained comedy gold like the one where two rapscallions fool the author and his friends into believing that a German singer who had actually made an Emperor sob and was renown for his pathos among certain more “sophisticated” circles ;who was about to sing to them and a few others in German - was actually known for his humour and often kept a straight face to make his “act" even more funnier.They advised the author and his two friends to laugh along while the German singer sang so that they wouldn't come across as uncultured. This chapter then after setting up a recipe for disaster ,lived upto it's potential by concluding with the funniest few pages in any book I've ever read.

The following review does a perfect job of illustrating the qualities I found myself attracted to in the novel.

> _The chief beauty of this book lies not so much in its literary style_, _or in the extent and usefulness of the information it conveys_, _as in its simple truthfulness_. _Its pages form the record of events that really happened_. _All that has been done is to colour them_; _and_, _for this_, _no extra charge has been made_. _George and Harris and Montmorency are not poetic ideals_, _but things of flesh and blood—especially George_, _who weighs about twelve stone_. _Other works may excel this in depth of thought and knowledge of human nature: other books may rival it in originality and size_; _but_, _for hopeless and incurable veracity_, _nothing yet discovered can surpass it_. _This_, _more than all its other charms_, _will_, _it is felt_, _make the volume precious in the eye of the earnest reader_; _and will lend additional weight to the lesson that the story teaches_.
