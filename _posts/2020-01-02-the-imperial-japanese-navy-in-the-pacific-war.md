Well, once again, I must eat crow. It appears **Mark E. Stille,** who I have criticized so viciously in his “80 page wonders” like this.

For being shallow perfunctory, and only suitable for elementary school children, has thankfully proven me wrong.

This book is probably **the** best on the Japanese Navy at large.

And he constructs it in an interesting way. He begins by discussing the big battles, and only then moves on to a ship type by ship type discussion. Most books I’ve read describe the fleet, then the battles. Mr. Stilles’ reversal is interesting, because first you see how the ships perform, which raises questions, then the ships are presented at the end when your questions are already percolating. No back and forth in this book. Event happens in battle, flip back to ship, then back to battle.

Mr. Stille has also had the wisdom to describe the battles briefly, with beautiful, easily understood maps, even for an idiot like me.

That wisdom extends to not spending 40 or 50 pages on each battle. When a 600 page book on the Battle of Midway already exists, why waste your allotted space rehashing?

The ship pictures are as you’d expect, as nicely done as the cover.

Rather than focus on structure or armor, or armaments, it focuses on _operational_ issues. Damage control, no CIC to manage the battle, the **entire** battle from a safe place. And the biggest shock to me, was no fighter director function. On US and British carriers, there are people who manage all airborne assets. “You fly top cover CAP. You intercept the incoming flight of land based bombers, and you lot Angels 10 in case there is a Torpedo plane attack”.

On Japanese carriers, they operated like a 4 year old kids soccer team. Everyone runs for, and clusters around, the ball, I.e. what has grabbed everyone’s attention. That one fact alone explains how Japan lost the Battle of Midway. And when you think about it, Coral Sea and others as well. The book is **full** of operational revelations no hardware/machinery/Gunnery book will capture.

Some more gratuitous pictures.

In any case, deepest apologies to Mark E. Stille, brilliant book. As my friends and often say, when Osprey Publishing gets it wrong, they get it wrong. But when the get it right, they get it **right!**

**Rating: 5 out of 5.**

I have never said this before, in the 82 reviews I have written. If you are a WW2 amateur historian, and are interested in the War in the Pacific,

**You MUST** have this book.
